# Satellite-based monitoring of dry and wet conditions using Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)

This is a fork repository from https://github.com/wfpidn/SPI which originally I wrote it during my service with WFP, and since I left the agency this guideline no longer maintained. So I will continue to update this at my personal Github repo.

The SPI analysis is following the training conducted in 28 Jan 2020 by [NASA ARSET](https://arset.gsfc.nasa.gov) on **Application of GPM IMERG Reanalysis for Assessing Extreme Dry and Wet Periods**.
